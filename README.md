1.3 - Basics Formula in Excel

Basic Formulas in Excel
Excel formulas are essential for performing calculations and data analysis. Here are some of the most commonly used basic formulas in Excel:

1. SUM
Calculates the sum of a range of numbers.

excel
=SUM(A1:A10)
Example: Adds all the numbers in cells A1 through A10.
2. AVERAGE
Calculates the average of a range of numbers.

excel
=AVERAGE(B1:B10)
Example: Computes the average of the numbers in cells B1 through B10.
3. MIN
Finds the smallest number in a range.

excel
=MIN(C1:C10)
Example: Returns the smallest number in cells C1 through C10.
4. MAX
Finds the largest number in a range.

excel
=MAX(D1:D10)
Example: Returns the largest number in cells D1 through D10.
5. COUNT
Counts the number of cells that contain numbers.

excel
=COUNT(E1:E10)
Example: Counts the cells with numbers in the range E1 through E10.
6. COUNTA
Counts the number of cells that are not empty.

excel
=COUNTA(F1:F10)
Example: Counts the non-empty cells in the range F1 through F10.
7. IF
Performs a logical test and returns one value for a TRUE result and another for a FALSE result.

excel
=IF(G1 > 50, "Pass", "Fail")
Example: Returns "Pass" if the value in G1 is greater than 50; otherwise, it returns "Fail".
8. CONCATENATE (or CONCAT)
Joins several text strings into one text string.

excel
=CONCATENATE(H1, " ", I1)
Example: Joins the text in cells H1 and I1 with a space in between.
9. VLOOKUP
Looks for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from another column.

excel
=VLOOKUP(J1, A1:B10, 2, FALSE)
Example: Searches for the value in J1 in the first column of the range A1:B10 and returns the corresponding value from the second column.
10. HLOOKUP
Looks for a value in the top row of a table and returns a value in the same column from a specified row.

excel
=HLOOKUP(K1, A1:Z10, 5, FALSE)
Example: Searches for the value in K1 in the top row of the range A1:Z10 and returns the corresponding value from the fifth row.
11. INDEX and MATCH
Used together to look up a value in a table based on both row and column indices.

excel
=INDEX(L1:L10, MATCH("Item", M1:M10, 0))
Example: Finds the position of "Item" in the range M1:M10 and returns the value from the corresponding position in the range L1:L10.
12. LEFT, RIGHT, MID
Extracts a specified number of characters from a text string.

excel
=LEFT(N1, 3)
=RIGHT(O1, 2)
=MID(P1, 2, 3)
Example:
LEFT(N1, 3) returns the first three characters from the text in cell N1.
RIGHT(O1, 2) returns the last two characters from the text in cell O1.
MID(P1, 2, 3) returns three characters from the text in cell P1, starting at the second character.
Summary
These basic formulas are fundamental for working with data in Excel. They allow you to perform a variety of calculations and data manipulations efficiently. Understanding and using these formulas will significantly enhance your productivity and data analysis capabilities in Excel.

Formatting Pointer in Excel
To use the pointer for formatting cells in Excel:

Select the Cell(s): Click on the cell or drag to select multiple cells.
Right-Click: Right-click to open the context menu.
Choose Format Cells: Select "Format Cells" from the menu.
Apply Formatting: In the Format Cells dialog box, choose the desired formatting options (e.g., Number, Font, Border).

Select the Range: Highlight the cells you want to format as a table.
Insert Table: Go to the Insert tab on the Ribbon.
Table Button: Click on the "Table" button.
Confirm Range: Ensure the correct range is selected and click OK.
Alt + = (AutoSum)
The Alt + = shortcut quickly inserts the SUM function to sum a range of cells:

Select the Cell: Click on the cell where you want the sum to appear.
Press Alt + =: This automatically adds the SUM function to the selected cell, summing the range above or to the left.
Confirm Range: Adjust the range if necessary and press Enter.
Difference Between AVERAGE and PERCENTAGE in Excel
AVERAGE
The AVERAGE function calculates the mean of a range of numbers.

Formula: =AVERAGE(range)
Example: =AVERAGE(A1:A10) calculates the average of the values in cells A1 through A10.
PERCENTAGE
Percentage in Excel is often used to show proportions. To convert a number to a percentage:

Formula: =number / total * 100
Example: If you have 100 marks and want to find the percentage of 75 marks:
excel
=75 / 100 * 100
This will give you 75%.
Example for Average and Percentage
Suppose you have marks in cells A1 to A5 as follows: 80, 90, 75, 85, 95.

Calculating the Average
Formula: =AVERAGE(A1:A5)
Result: The average marks of the five students.
Calculating the Percentage of Marks
To calculate the percentage of a specific mark (e.g., 75 out of 100):

Formula: =75 / 100 * 100
Result: 75%
Summary
Formatting Pointer: Use right-click and "Format Cells" to apply desired formatting.
Format as Table: Use the Insert tab and "Table" button to format a range as a table.
Alt + = (AutoSum): Quickly insert the SUM function with Alt + =.
AVERAGE vs. PERCENTAGE: AVERAGE calculates the mean, while PERCENTAGE shows proportions. Calculate average with =AVERAGE(range) and percentage with =number / total * 100.
Understanding these Excel features and functions will help you manage and analyze your data more effectively.
